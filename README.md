# TfLearn

This repository contains the code necessary to train and evaluate a model using TFlearn. 
I trained 8 different neural networks on the same dataset to compare how they behave.<br><br> 
First create a npy format testset and a trainingset using the create_testset.py create_trainingset.py scripts. <br>
The next step is to train the 8 models using the train.py file. There is a variant to train the same models using <br>
data augmentation techniques. <br>
The final step is to evaluate the models using one of the first 3 scripts.
